# hosts

ad and porn websites that I come across,
that are not blocked by other famous hosts files.

the file `safesearch` forces google's (and potentially other search engines) safesearch.

other anti-porn hosts files:

## add.sh

if you want to contribute, you can use `add.sh` to
add your websites in:

```sh
./add.sh abc.com xyz.com ...
git push
```

or put the list of sites in a text file, one per line;
then:

```sh
./add.sh list-of-sites.txt
git push
```

it automatically sorts the list and adds www variants
as well.
